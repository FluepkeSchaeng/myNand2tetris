# myNand2tetris
my personal nand2tetris project

I watch the [YouToube series][1] on the TeaLeaves channel, here are some recommentations for other options to learn:

- [Website][2] for the hardware section of nand2tetris
- [Digital Logic Design: The Game][3] on Github
- The game [MHRD][4] on Steam
- maybe learning Verilog or VHDL instead for usage in the real world.
